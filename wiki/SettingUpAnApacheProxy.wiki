#How to configure apache httpd server to act as a proxy for an XML/A server.

= Introduction =
Xmla.js uses the XMLHttpRequest object to post SOAP requests and receive SOAP responses to a XML/A webservice. The XMLHttpRequest it is bound to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy same origin policy]. This means you can't use Xmla.js to do cross-domain requests.

Effectively this means that webpages that want to use Xmla.js must reside on the same web server as where the XML/A webservice lives. Alternatively, the server where Xmla.js resides can define a proxy to one or more XML/A servers so that it appears as if they are hosted by the same server. 

This page contains instructions for setting up a proxy on the popular Apache http server.

=Setting Xmla4js in Apache http server to connect to a remote XML/A server=
It's possible to work around the ame origin policy and use Xmla4js to access remote XML/A servers. In this case, Xmla4js will be served from a regular HTTP server like Apache, but send SOAP requests to an external XML/A server. 

In order to make this kind of setup work, the regular HTTP server (the one where Xmla4js is deployed) has to act as a proxy for the remote XML/A server. That's because the XMLHttpRequest object used by Xmla4js is restricted from doing cross-domain requests. This is not a property of Xmla4js but a general security measure (see also http://developer.yahoo.com/javascript/howto-proxy.html).

Here's a sample configuration file for Apache httpd:
{{{
#
# make D:\Projects\xmla4js accessible from the webhost as http://webhost/xmla4js
#
Alias /xmla4js     "D:\Projects\xmla4js"

#
# cofigure access to the resources in the xmla4js home directory
#
<Directory "D:\Projects\xmla4js">
  Options All
  AllowOverride All
  Order allow,deny
  Allow from all
</Directory>
