= Introduction =

Xmla.js is simply a javascript library. All it takes to start using it, is to create a web page, and use a <script> tag to include the Xmla.js library. 

However, because Xmla.js uses HTTP requests to post SOAP requests (and receive SOAP responses) to a XML/A webservice, it is bound to the same origin policy. Effectively this means that webpages that want to use Xmla.js must reside on the same web server as where the XML/A webservice lives.

The steps described on this page assume you have downloaded and unpacked the Pentaho BI server on your local system. You can download it from the Pentaho project page on sourceforge. The remainder of this page will assume that the Pentaho BI Server is started and has a default configuration. You can check this by navigating to http://localhost:8080/ with your webbrowser. This should redirect you to http://localhost:8080/pentaho, and show you the welcome page with a login button.

For other XML/A providers, the steps to get started with xmla4js are almost certainly similar, although details such as specific paths and urls are likely to differ. You are encouraged to contribute feedback and information on how to set up Xmla.js on other XML/A servers.

== Setting up Xmla4js on the Pentaho BI server ==
First, you need to open a shell and change the current working directory to the tomcat/webapps directory located in the home directory of the Pentaho BI server. Suppose you unpacked the compressed archive of the Pentaho BI server to /opt/pentaho, then you should cd to /opt/pentaho/biserver-ce/tomcat/webapps.

=== With the .zip archive ===
One way of getting xmla4js is by downloading the xmla4js.zip archive from the downloads page. For your convenience the address to the download page is included below: 

http://code.google.com/p/xmla4js/downloads/detail?name=xmla4js.zip

After downloading, unzip the archive, and copy the xmla4js directory (and its contents) to the webapps directory.

=== With subversion checkout ===
Another way of getting xmla4js is by doing a subversion checkout in the webapps directory. The command line to checkout the project can be found here:

    http://code.google.com/p/xmla4js/source/checkout

For your convenience, the command-line is included here too:

    svn checkout http://xmla4js.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ xmla4js-read-only

This will create a xmla4js-read-only directory in tomcat's webapps directory.

== Next steps ==

After placing xmla4js on your system,you should be able to navigate your browser to:

    http://localhost:8080/xmla4js-read-only/index.html

From there, you can follow the links to the API documentation and various sample pages.
